* Python PostgreSQL Application

The application uses Psycopg2 Psycopg2 module to connect to PostgreSQL and
perform SQL queries, database operations. I'm assuming you alrealy have a
PostgresSQL database configured.

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/yanbentes/postpy.git
#+end_src

You need to install Psycopg2 to use PostgreSQL from Python. This module is
available on pypi.org.

to install with pip command

#+begin_src bash
pip install psycopg2
#+end_src

or if you are using anaconda

#+begin_src bash
conda install -c anaconda psycopg2
#+end_src

** Operations

The application is able to do CREATE, UPTADE, DELETE and a fell more operations.
It has a simple menu in written in portuguese that you can choose the operation that you
want to execute.
